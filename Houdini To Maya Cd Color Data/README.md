# Houdini To Maya Cd Color Data

A presentation showing how to make a binary counter without keyframes using Python in Cinema 4D and Maya, VEX in Houdini, and Expressions in After Effects. 

The inspiration for this comes from the movie Mission To Mars and my love for cinematography and math! Please enjoy!
